<h2>	    The ATIS Spoken Language Systems Pilot Corpus
</h2> <p>
      Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, George R. Doddington
</p><p>
<b>
Abstract
</b> </p><p>
Speech research has made tremendous progress in the past using the
following paradigm:
</p><ul>
<li> define the research problem,
</li><li> collect a corpus to objectively measure progress, and
</li><li> solve the research problem.
</li></ul>
Natural language research has typically progressed without the benefit
of any corpus of data with which to test research hypotheses.  We
describe the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) pilot corpus, a
corpus designed to measure progress in Spoken Language Systems that
include both a speech and natural language component.  This pilot
marks the first full-scale attempt to collect such a corpus and
provides guidelines for future efforts.
<p> <b>

1. Introduction
</b> </p><p>
The ATIS corpus provides an opportunity to develop and evaluate speech
systems that understand spontaneous speech.  This corpus differs from
its predecessor, the Resource Management corpus (Price et al, 1988),
in at least four significant ways.
</p><ul>
<li> Instead of being read, the speech has many of the characteristics of
spontaneous spoken language (e.g., dysfluencies, false starts, and
colloquial pronunciations).

</li><li> The speech collection occurs in an office environment rather than a
sound booth.

</li><li> The grammar becomes part of the system under evaluation rather than
a given part of the experiment.

</li><li> The reference answer consists of the actual reply for the utterance
rather than an orthographic transcription of the speech.
</li></ul>

The evaluation methodology supported by ATIS depends on having a
comparable representation of the answer for each utterance.  This is
accomplished by limiting the utterances to database queries, and the
answers to a ground set of tuples from a fixed relational database.
The ATIS corpus comprises the acoustic speech data for a query,
transcriptions of that query, a set of tuples that constitute the
answer, and the SQL expression for the query that produced the answer
tuples.
<p>
The ATIS database consists of data obtained from the Official Airline
Guide (OAG, 1990), organized under a relational schema.  The database
remained fixed throughout the pilot phase.  It contains information
about flights, fares, airlines, cities, airports, and ground services,
and includes twenty-five supporting tables.  The large majority of the
questions posed by subjects can be answered from the database with a
single relational query.
</p><p>
To collect the kind of English expected in a real working system, we
simulate one.  The subject, or ``travel planner,'' is in one room,
with those running the simulation in another.  The subject speaks
requests over a microphone and receives both a transcription of the
speech and the answer on a computer screen.  A session lasts
approximately one hour, including detailed preliminary instructions
and an exit questionnaire.
</p><p>
Two ``wizards'' carry out the simulation: one transcribes the query
while the other produces the answer.  The transcriber interprets any
verbal editing by the subject and removes dysfluencies in order to
produce an orthographic transcription of what the subject intended to
say.  At the same time, the answerer uses a natural language-oriented
command language to produce an SQL expression that elicits the correct
answer for the subject.  On-line utilities maintain a complete log of
the session, including time stamps.
</p><p>
At the conclusion of the session, the utterances are sorted into
categories to determine those utterances suitable for objective
evaluation.  Finally, each utterance receives three different
transcriptions.  First, a checked version of the transcription
produced during the session provides an appropriate input string for
evaluating text-based natural language systems.  Second, a slightly
expanded version of this serves as a prompt in collecting a read
version of the spontaneously spoken sentences.  Finally, a more
detailed orthographic transcription represents the speech actually
uttered by the subject, appropriate for use in acoustic modeling.
</p><p><b>

2. Corpus Collection
</b> </p><p>
About one session a day was conducted, using subjects recruited from
within Texas Instruments.  A typical session included approximately 20
minutes of introduction, 40 minutes of query time and 10 minutes for
follow-up.  Each session resulted in two speech files for each query
and a complete log of the session.
</p><p> <b>

2.1 Session Introduction
</b> </p><p>
The subjects were given the following instructions, both orally and in
writing:
</p><dl> <dd>
   The Air Travel Information System (ATIS) is a prototype of a
   voice-input information retrieval system.  It has the same
   information that is contained in the Official Airline Guide (OAG)
   to help you make air travel plans.  We would like you to
   participate in a trial use of this experimental system.
</dd></dl>
Subjects were not told whether that the ``experimental system'' was
totally automated or involved human intervention.  It was hoped that
most subjects would believe that the system was real to elicit natural
speech.
<p>
Subjects were informed about the contents of the relational database
in a one page summary.  The summary described the major database
entities in fairly general terms to avoid influencing the vocabulary
used during the session.  To avoid some misconceptions in advance,
subjects were told that the database did not contain information about
hotels or rental cars.
</p><p>
The subject was next assigned a travel planning scenario,
systematically chosen from a set of six scenarios designed to exercise
various aspects of the database.  For example, some scenarios focused
on flight time constraints while others concentrated on fares.  The
scenarios did not specify particular times or cities in an effort to
make the scenario more personal to the subject.  The following example
illustrates this:
</p><dl> <dd>
   Plan the travel arrangements for a small family reunion.  First
   pick a city where the get-together will be held.  From 3 different
   cities (of your choice), find travel arrangements that are suitable
   for the family members who typify the ``economy'', ``high class'',
   and ``adventurous'' life styles.
</dd></dl>
After receiving the scenario, subjects were left with the instructions
and given five minutes to plan the details of the scenarios.
Subjects were given pen and paper on which to write the details and to
take notes during the session.
<p>
Finally, subjects were given instructions regarding the operation of
the system.  The ``system'', from the subjects perspective, consisted
of a 19 inch color monitor running the X Window System, and a
head-mounted Sennheiser (HMD 410-6) microphone.  A desk mounted Crown
(PCC-160 phase coherent cardioid) microphone was also used to record
the speech.  The ``office'' contained a sparc-station cpu and disk to
replicate office noise, and a wall map of the United States to help
subjects solve their scenarios.
</p><p>
The monitor screen was divided into two regions: a large, scrollable
window for system output and a smaller window for speech interaction.
The system used a ``push-to-talk'' input mechanism, whereby speech
collection occurred while a suitably marked mouse button was
depressed.  Subjects were given the opportunity to cancel an utterance
for a period of time equal to the length of the utterance.
</p><p>
A single sentence was used for all subjects to illustrate the
push-to-talk mechanism and interaction with the system:
</p><dl> <dd> 
   Show me all the nonstop flights between Atlanta and Philadelphia.
</dd></dl>
This sentence was processed as if the system actually responded to the
utterance, including a transcription of the speech on the subject's
display followed by the answer in table format.

<p> <b>
2.2 Session Queries
</b> </p><p>
After the introduction, subjects were given approximately 40 minutes
to complete the task described in the scenario.  If they finished
early, subjects were instructed to select another scenario or to
explore the capabilities of the system.  After the 40 minutes,
subjects were given the opportunity to continue, finally ending the
session by saying ``all done''.
</p><p>
Once the actual session started, subjects cycled through thinking,
querying, waiting, and writing.  While the thinking portion of the
session actually required the most time, the query portion required
the most resources.
</p><p>
Several things happened at once as a given subject spoke a query.
While speech from both the head-mounted and desk-mounted microphones
was recorded, one wizard began to transcribe the speech and the other
wizard began to answer the query.  A playback capability could be used
if needed by the transcription wizard.  The answer wizard was
constrained not to send the answer before the transcription wizard
finished the transcription.  Typically, the subject received the typed
transcription a few seconds after speaking and the answer
approximately 20 seconds later.
</p><p>
Each wizard each had their own X Window terminal.  The transcription
wizard used a gnuemacs-based tool that checked the spelling of the
transcription and sent the transcription to both the answer wizard and
the subject.  Despite the transcription wizard's best efforts, some
transcription mistakes did reach the subject: occasionally words were
omitted, inserted, or substituted (e.g., ``fight'' for ``flight'').
</p><p>
The answer wizard used a tool called NLParse (Hemphill et al,
1987) to form the answer to the subjects queries.  This tool used a
natural language-oriented command language to produce a set of tuples
for the answer.  NLParse provides a set of menus to help convey the
limited coverage to the wizard.  In practice, the answer wizard knew
the coverage and used typing with escape completion to enter the
appropriate NLParse command.  NLParse provides several advantages as
a wizard tool:
</p><ul>
<li> every answerable query (with respect to the database) receives an
answer,
</li><li> the NLParse query language avoids ambiguity,
</li><li> the wizard formulates the answer in terms of database entities, and
</li><li> the wizard can easily discern the correctness of the answer.
</li></ul>
However, the NLParse query language was not originally designed for
rapid query entry, prompting several small grammar enhancements
during the pilot.
<p>
The answer wizard's terminal also included a gnuemacs-based utility
that created a session log.  This included the transcription, the
NLParse input, the resulting SQL expression, and the set of tuples
constituting the answer.  The answer wizard sent only the set of
tuples to the subject.

</p><p> <b>
2.3 The ATIS Database
</b> </p><p>
The ATIS database was designed to model as much of a real-world
resource as possible.  In particular, we tried to model the printed
OAG in a straightforward manner.  With this approach, we could rely on
travel data expertise from Official Airline Guides, Incorporated.  We
also used the data directly from the OAG and did not invent any data -
something that is difficult to accomplish in a realistic manner.
Additionally, the printed OAG was available to all sites and provided
a form of documentation for the database.
</p><p>
The relational schema were designed to help answer queries in an
intuitive manner, with no attempt to maximize the speech collected
(e.g., by supplying narrow tables as answers).  Toward this end,
entities were represented with simple sets or lists in the most direct
way.
</p><p> <b>

2.4 Session Follow-Up
</b> </p><p>
After the query phase of the session, subjects were given a brief
questionnaire to let us know what they thought of the system.  This
consisted of the following ten questions with possible answers of
``yes'' ``maybe/sometimes'', ``no'' or ``no opinion'':
</p><ol>
 <li> Were you able to get the travel information you needed?
 </li><li> Were you satisfied with the way the information was presented?
 </li><li> Did the responses contain the kinds of information you were seeking?
 </li><li> Were the answers provided quickly enough?
 </li><li> Would you prefer this method to looking up the information in a book?
 </li><li> Did the system understand your requests the first time?
 </li><li> If the system did not understand you, could you easily find 
        another way to get the information on a later try?
 </li><li> Was the travel planning scenario appropriate for a trial use of the system?
 </li><li> Do you think a person unfamiliar with computers could use the system easily?
 </li><li>Do you think a human was interpreting your questions?
</li></ol>

After the questionnaire, the subjects were given a chance to ask
questions, and were informed that the system was a simulation
involving human intervention.  Finally, we thanked our subjects with
their choice of either a mug or a T-shirt.
<p> <b>

3. Corpus Processing
</b> </p><p>
After data collection, a rather elaborate series of processing steps
was required before the subject's utterances actually became part of
the corpus.  A session resulted in a set of speech files and a session
log that formed the raw materials for the corpus.

</p><p> <b>
3.1 Transcriptions
</b> </p><p>
To facilitate use of the corpus, three transcriptions were provided
with each query.  A more detailed transcription document specifies the
details of these, with the rationale explained below.
</p><ul>

<li> NL_input: 
  This transcription is a corrected version of the on-the-fly session
  transcription, corrected while reviewing the subject's speech
  off-line.  This transcription reflects the speech as the subject
  meant to say it, that is, dysfluencies corrected verbally by the
  subject were corrected.  The orthography of the transcription obeys
  common English conventions.  It is suitable as input to a text-based
  natural language systems.  Example:
<dl> <dd>
     Where is the stop for USAir flight number 37 from Philadelphia to
     San Francisco?
</dd></dl>
</li><li> prompting_text: 
  This transcription expands any acoustically ambiguous lexical tokens
  found in the NL_input transcription while listening to the subject's
  speech.  This transcription serves as a prompt in a later
  read-speech session, allowing a comparisons of read and spontaneous
  speech.  Example:
<dl> <dd>
     Where is the stop for USAir flight number thirty-seven from
     Philadelphia to San Francisco?
</dd></dl>
</li><li> SR_output: 

  This transcription includes a detailed description of the major
  acoustic events in the query.  It is created from the prompting_text
  while listening to the subject's speech and includes all the
  dysfluencies previously ignored.  Abbreviations and numbers are
  expanded to eliminate open-class lexical items.  This transcription
  serves as a point of comparison for speech recognition systems that
  output an orthographic transcription.  Example:
<dl> <dd>
     Where is the stop [uh] for U S, Air flight number thirty seven,
     from Philadelphia to San Francisco
</dd></dl> 

For interim testing purposes, a Standard, Normalized Orthographic
Representation (SNOR) was created algorithmically from the SR_output
transcription.  Punctuation and dysfluencies were removed, resulting
in something resembling the NL_input transcription, but with
abbreviations and numbers expanded.  Example:
<dl> <dd>
   WHERE IS THE STOP FOR U S AIR FLIGHT NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN FROM
   PHILADELPHIA TO SAN FRANCISCO
</dd></dl>
</li></ul> <p> <b>
3.2 Classification
</b> </p><p>
Not all queries were equally suited for evaluating spoken language
systems.  Accordingly, each query received a classification to help
circumscribe the types of queries desired for training and testing.
The classifications themselves were determined through a committee and
defined several dimensions:
</p><ul>
<li> context-dependent/context-removable/context-independent
</li><li> ambiguous (vague)/clear
</li><li> unanswerable/answerable
</li><li> ill-formed (grossly)/well-formed
</li><li> noncooperative/cooperative
</li></ul>

The committee defined evaluable queries (for June, 1990) as those not
classified by the first term in each set.  In addition to these, the
following simple classifications were supplied to help sites analyze
results:
<ul> 
<li> ungrammatical/grammatical
</li><li> multi-sentence/single-sentence
</li></ul> <b>

3.3 Reference Interpretation
</b> <p>
An interpretation document was defined, which specifies the details of
how to interpret an ATIS query, both for the answer wizard and for the
SLS sites.  For example, for consistency it was ruled that a flight
serving a snack would be considered as a flight with a meal.  The
document provides a mapping of concepts expressed in English to
concepts encoded in the relational database.  The NLParse commands
reflect these conventions and were included in the corpus to
facilitate maintenance since it was usually easier to determine the
correctness of the reference answer by looking at the NLParse command
rather than the resulting SQL expression.  In the event of an
erroneous answer, correction occurs by simply amending the NLParse
command.

</p><p> <b>
3.4 Reference SQL
</b> </p><p>
The pilot corpus includes the ANSI-standard SQL expression that
produced the reference answer, which is the ``final word'' on the
interpretation of a subject's query.  It also provides some degree of
database independence.  For example, as long as the relational schema
remain fixed, we can add new cities to the database, rerun the SQL
against the database, and produce a new corpus that includes the new
cities.  This works as long as the evaluation criteria excludes
context-dependent queries.

</p><p> <b>
3.5 Reference Answer
</b> </p><p>
The reference answer consists of the set of tuples resulting from the
evaluation of the reference SQL with respect to the official ATIS
database.  This is actually redundant, but makes scoring easier for
most sites. The tuples are formatted according the Common Answer
Specification (CAS) format (Boisen et al, 1989).  This format amounts
to representing the answer in Lisp syntax to aid in automatic scoring.

</p><p> <b>
3.6 Corpus Files
</b> </p><p>
All of the items mentioned above were formatted into files and shipped
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  NIST
then distributed the corpus to interested sites.  A file format
document exists to help sites install the data.
</p><p> <b>
4. Results
</b> </p><p>
Forty-one sessions containing 1041 utterances were collected over 8
weeks, nine of which were designated as training material by NIST.
Each session consisted of 25.4 queries per session on average.
Table 1 describes the utterance statistics for each
Pilot Distribution (PD).

Table 2 describes the time statistics for each PD.  Each session
consisted of approximately 40 minutes of query time with an average
rate of 39.1 queries per hour.  The average time between queries of
1.5 minutes included subject thinking time, and about 22 seconds for
the wizard to send the answer to the subject after the transcription.

The average utterance length (in words) varied according to the
transcription: 10.2 for NL_input, 11.7 for SR_output (expanded lexical
items and dysfluencies), and 11.3 for NL_SNOR (expanded lexical
items).  Eighteen percent of the utterances contained some form of
dysfluency.
<p>
Of the 1041 utterances collected, 740 were judged evaluable according
to the June 1990 criteria: not classified as context-dependent,
ambiguous, ill-formed, unanswerable, or noncooperative.  These results
are shown in Table 3, broken down according to PD.  The table also
shows that if we relax these criteria to exclude only ambiguous and
unanswerable utterances, the yield would increase from 71% to 80%.

Subjects generally enjoyed the sessions, as reflected in Table 4 (the
tally includes two subjects not included in the corpus).  The answers
to questions were typically not provided quickly enough, as might be
expected in a simulation.  Some subjects defined an acceptable
response time as under 5 seconds.  Of the subjects that thought a
human was interpreting the questions, some knew in advance, some
misinterpreted the question (``Did the system BEHAVE as if a human was
interpreting your questions?''), and some were tipped-off by the
amazing ability of the system to recognize speech in the face of gross
dysfluencies.

Subjects also supplied general comments.  Some
subjects felt uncomfortable with computers or the system:
<dl> <dd>
   ``The topic was not my thing, but the voice activation was
   fascinating.''
</dd></dl>
while other subjects were more enthusiastic:
<dl> <dd>
   ``The system looks like a winner.  It needs some fine-tuning and
   perhaps faster response, but otherwise it's a very promising tool.''

5. Conclusions
</b> <p>
The ATIS SLS pilot corpus has proved that objective evaluation of
spoken language systems is both possible and beneficial.  The pilot
corpus has also served to clarify many points in the data collection
procedure.  In this effort, we have learned that a spontaneous speech
corpus is more expensive to collect than a read speech one, but
provides an opportunity to evaluate spoken language systems under
realistic conditions.  Above all, we hope that this corpus and its
successors further research in spoken language systems.
